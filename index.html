                    With two glass collection bottles, you can handle larger volumes of fluid without constant emptying. It’s perfect for settings where uninterrupted use is critical.
                </p>

                    2. Adjustable Vacuum Pressure
                </p>
                <p>
                    The VC-2 gives you full control over the suction level, allowing you to tailor the vacuum strength to each procedure or patient.
                </p>
                <p>
                    3. Heavy-Duty Construction

                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite its power, the VC-2 runs quietly. That’s important in both clinical and home environments where noise levels can impact patient comfort.
                </p>
                <p>5. Mobility and Portability</p>
